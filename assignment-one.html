            <h2>Healthy Eating</h2>
            <p>Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting
                nutrition and diet advice out there, you’re not alone. It seems that for every expert who tells you a
                certain food is good for you, you’ll find another saying exactly the opposite. The truth is that while
                some specific foods or nutrients have been shown to have a beneficial effect on mood, it’s your overall
                dietary pattern that is most important. </p>
